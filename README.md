# Note :

This project will be reworked in the near future and split into multiple sub-projects including :
- High performance data loader
- High performance data processor (planned support for multicore, distributed and GPGPU computation)
- Time series forecaster with support for more advanced techniques (e.g. weight averaging, ensemble models...)
- Time series forecasting error visualizations
